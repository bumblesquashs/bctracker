        <h3>More Transit Systems</h3>
        July 12, 2021
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            You asked for it, and we listened!
            That's right, BCTracker now supports multiple transit systems across British Columbia.
        </p>
        <p>
            We're starting with 10 cities and regions from around the province, and we plan to add more in the future.
            These initial systems include all seven currently enabled with realtime information, as well as three that only provide schedule data.
            You can easily swap between these systems at any time using the dropdown at the top right corner of your screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to all the new transit systems, we've also made a bunch of improvements to the general website design.
            System-wide realtime maps, route maps and information panels, improved desktop layouts, and many more useful features are now available!
        </p>
        <p>
            There's always more to do, and your feedback helps us figure out what comes next.
            You can send an email to <a href="mailto:james@bctracker.ca">james@bctracker.ca</a> to let us know what you like and what can be made better.
        </p>
        <p>
            Have a great summer!

        <h3>New Website Look</h3>
        August 21, 2020
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            BCTracker has a new look!
            We've been working hard to get this updated design ready, and there's a lot of new things for you to enjoy - including full mobile support, improved realtime navigation, maps, and much more.
        </p>
        <p>
            We've also moved the website to a new address at <a href="http://bctracker.ca">bctracker.ca</a>.
            The old URL will continue to be usable for a while, but if you've bookmarked any pages you'll want to make sure they're updated.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the next few weeks we'll be making more changes to the systems that make the website work behind the scenes.
            You (hopefully) won't notice any differences, but it will allow us to add lots more new and exciting stuff in the future.
            We're always looking for ways to improve the website even more, and your feedback is always welcome.
            Send us an email anytime at <a href="mailto:james@bctracker.ca">james@bctracker.ca</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Enjoy!
