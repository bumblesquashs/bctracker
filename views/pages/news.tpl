        <h3>Winter Update</h3>
        January 2, 2022
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Hey everyone, it's once again time for a quick(ish) update!
        </p>
        <p>
            First of all, a huge thank you to everyone who has participated in our survey so far!
            Your feedback has been very helpful in planning upcoming additions to the site, and we're glad to know how helpful BCTracker has been for you.
            If you haven't had a chance to respond yet, you can still get to it from the link in the previous post.
        </p>
        <p>
            We've gotten a lot done over the last few months, some of which you may have already noticed, while other things have only just recently been added.
            Many of the newest features are among the most highly-requested in the survey responses, so we hope you enjoy them!
            Here's an overview of what's new:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Realtime Frequency: Now updates every minute for even more accurate bus positions</li>
            <li>Global Search: An easy way to find buses, routes, and stops from anywhere on the website</li>
            <li>Upcoming Departures: Trips leaving a stop in the next 30 minutes, including realtime bus information when available</li>
            <li>Transfers and First Seen: Historic updates for when buses are transferred between systems, and when they were recorded for the first time</li>
            <li>Block/Trip History: All recorded realtime history for blocks and trips</li>
            <li>Map Improvements: Full-screen, interactive maps for buses, routes, stops, blocks, and trips</li>
            <li>Some pretty big improvements behind the scenes that made a lot of these updates possible</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Finally, we've updated our <a href="/about">About</a> page with some FAQs, based on some of the survey results we got back.
            We hope the answers are enlightening!
        </p>
        <p>
            As always, stay safe and have a Happy New Year!

        <h3>BCTracker Survey</h3>
        November 28, 2021
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            We're running a quick survey over the next few weeks to get a better sense of who is using BCTracker, and for what purpose.
            This information will help us understand what new features should have the highest priority, as well as what improvements can be made to existing features.
            It's also a great opportunity for you to give us general feedback about things you like and things you think could be better.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have a couple spare minutes, we would very much appreciate hearing from you.
            Thanks for supporting BCTracker!
        </p>

        <h3>Fall Update</h3>
        September 21, 2021
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Over the last couple months you may have noticed some exciting new features appearing around the website.
            We're trying to keep updates more frequent, rather than releasing massive changes once or twice per year.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the big multi-system update earlier this summer, we've introduced:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Schedule Adherence: How many minutes ahead or behind schedule a bus is (approximately)</li>
            <li>Nearby Stops: Easy transfers that are within 100m of the stop you're looking at</li>
            <li>Dark Theme: Can be set automatically based on your device's current preferences, or set manually</li>
            <li>Tablet Layouts: Specially designed for screens bigger than a phone but smaller than a computer</li>
            <li>Lots more minor improvements and fixes behind the scenes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We appreciate your feedback, and we're looking forward to turning more of your suggestions into new features and improvements.
            Stay tuned for more this fall!

        <h3>More Transit Systems</h3>
        July 12, 2021
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            You asked for it, and we listened!
            That's right, BCTracker now supports multiple transit systems across British Columbia.
        </p>
        <p>
            We're starting with 10 cities and regions from around the province, and we plan to add more in the future.
            These initial systems include all seven currently enabled with realtime information, as well as three that only provide schedule data.
            You can easily swap between these systems at any time using the dropdown at the top right corner of your screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to all the new transit systems, we've also made a bunch of improvements to the general website design.
            System-wide realtime maps, route maps and information panels, improved desktop layouts, and many more useful features are now available!
        </p>
        <p>
            There's always more to do, and your feedback helps us figure out what comes next.
            You can send an email to <a href="mailto:james@bctracker.ca">james@bctracker.ca</a> to let us know what you like and what can be made better.
        </p>
        <p>
            Have a great summer!

        <h3>New Website Look</h3>
        August 21, 2020
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            BCTracker has a new look!
            We've been working hard to get this updated design ready, and there's a lot of new things for you to enjoy - including full mobile support, improved realtime navigation, maps, and much more.
        </p>
        <p>
            We've also moved the website to a new address at <a href="http://bctracker.ca">bctracker.ca</a>.
            The old URL will continue to be usable for a while, but if you've bookmarked any pages you'll want to make sure they're updated.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the next few weeks we'll be making more changes to the systems that make the website work behind the scenes.
            You (hopefully) won't notice any differences, but it will allow us to add lots more new and exciting stuff in the future.
            We're always looking for ways to improve the website even more, and your feedback is always welcome.
            Send us an email anytime at <a href="mailto:james@bctracker.ca">james@bctracker.ca</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Enjoy!
